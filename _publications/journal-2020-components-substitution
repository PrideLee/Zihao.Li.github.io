## Abstract
Due to the high-quality requirements and advanced technical performance of the components used in space science equipment, the component substitution relationship is more complicated. The definition of substitution relation of the components used in space science devices and the five basic properties of substitution relation was proposed. Considered the functional performance, use environment, and reliability of the components, the standard substitution relation types of components were given. Besides, the mathematical representation methods of different substitution relation and the substitution index system were also developed. Finally, the cases of various substitution relations of space science equipment components were introduced.
